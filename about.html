    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p><em><strong>"Tinyhomes is more than a tinyhome, it's a memory.</strong></em></p>
    <p>We believe everyone deserves access to shelter, high-quality ones. Our mission is to make comfort and sustainability and to let everyone use it.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p><strong>The Story Behind Affordin</strong></p>
    <p>Affordin began with a simple but powerful idea: <strong>everyone deserves a space to call home</strong>, a space that's not only affordable, but smart, sustainable, and designed for real life. Founded in 2025 by Yizhe, Affordin was born out of frustration with rising housing costs and the lack of flexible living options. We saw families squeezed into overpriced rentals, students juggling unstable rent, and workers commuting hours just to afford shelter. So we asked: What if home could be reimagined?</p>
    <p>Our answer was the <strong><em>Affordin</em></strong>, tech-enhanced living unit built for comfort, efficiency, and accessibility. Each unit is equipped with modern technology: smart climate control, energy-efficient lighting, and seamless connectivity.</p>
